# Shell Scripts

A collection of shell scripts I use on daily basis on my Linux box.
* r_lamp
* r_pdfoptimize
* r_svgcleaner
* r_reabak


# Installing shell-scripts on Linux

Download the source code from this repository or use a git clone and execute install.sh:

	git clone https://github.com/rolodoom/shell-scripts.git
	chmod +x shell-scripts/install.sh && ./shell-scripts/install.sh
	
# The Scripts Are Located in /usr/local/bin

I usually store this scripts in:

	/usr/local/bin

I use 'r_' as preffix so I don't get confuse with system commands:

	r_command
